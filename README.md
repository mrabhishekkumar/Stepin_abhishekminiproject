## INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE (IPL)

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league, contested by eight teams based out of eight different Indian cities. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007.The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues.The new players though talented didn’t have a platform to showcase their achievements and get into the franchises. The BCCI (Indian cricket board) came up with a plan of building a website portal for the players to enter their details. The BCCI president Mr. Saurav Ganguly asked you to create a model class so that using your model class and the details, the web developers can get the data and feed them into their databases. So without any delay, let’s start working on our project.
